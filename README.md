# About Dataset
## RSMC Best Track Dataset
This dataset contains the weather informations related to typhoons. A tropical cyclone that develops in the Northern Hemisphere[1].

The original data was provided by Japan Meteorological Agency(JMA) in txt format. So I converted it into csv fortmat which is much more friendly and useful in modern data analysis.

Feel free to notice me about any inconvinience or wrong parts of dataset via email on my profile.
